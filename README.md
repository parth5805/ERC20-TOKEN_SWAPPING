# ERC20-TOKEN_SWAPPING

Deploy two erc20 smart contracts. 

Create one swapping smart contract where you can send one erc20 token and get other erc20 token in ratio 1:4.

It should work as follows : 

Suppose your token swapping smart contract swaps two tokens, Token-A and Token-B

When someone sends Token-A in your contract you give them Token-B in ration 1:4 i.e for 1 Token-A received by your contract you send 4 Token-B token to the user.
